<i>The voice of the Sword from the heart of the Sword</i><br />
<i>Clanging imperious</i><br />
<i>Forth from Time&rsquo;s battlements</i><br />
<i>His ancient and triumphing Song</i>.</p>
<p>In the beginning,<br />
Ere God inspired Himself<br />
Into the clay thing<br />
Thumbed to His image,<br />
The vacant, the naked shell<br />
Soon to be Man:<br />
<!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Thoughtful He pondered it,<br />
Prone there and impotent,<br />
Fragile, inviting<br />
Attack and discomfiture:<br />
Then, with a smile&mdash;<br />
As He heard in the Thunder<br />
That laughed over Eden<br />
The voice of the Trumpet,<br />
The iron Beneficence,<br />
Calling His dooms<br />
To the Winds of the world&mdash;<br />
Stooping, He drew<br />
On the sand with His finger<br />
A shape for a sign<br />
Of His way to the eyes<br />
That in wonder should waken,<br />
For a proof of His will<br />
To the breaking intelligence:<br />
<!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>That was the birth of me:<br />
I am the Sword.</p>
<p>Hard and bleak, keen and cruel,<br />
Short-hilted, long-shafted,<br />
I froze into steel:<br />
And the blood of my elder,<br />
His hand on the hafts of me,<br />
Sprang like a wave<br />
In the wind, as the sense<br />
Of his strength grew to ecstasy,<br />
Glowed like a coal<br />
At the throat of the furnace,<br />
As he knew me and named me<br />
The War-Thing, the Comrade,<br />
Father of honour<br />
And giver of kingship,<br />
The fame-smith, the song-master,<br />

Handmaid of heroes,<br />
Calling the peers<br />
To the place of espousal!<br />
Ho! then, the splendour<br />
And sheen of my ministry,<br />
Clothing the earth<br />
With a livery of lightnings!<br />
Ho! then, the music<br />
Of battles in onset<br />
And ruining armours,<br />
And God&rsquo;s gift returning<br />
In fury to God!<br />

<p>Heroes, my children,<br />
Follow, O follow me,<br />
Follow, exulting<br />
In the great light that breaks<br />
From the sacred companionship:<br />
Thrust through the fatuous,<br />
Thrust through the fungous brood<br />

Thrust through, and hearken,<br />

On the hand of the Master&mdash;<br />

Unappeasable Grisliness<br />
Prone down the nethermost<br />
Chasms of the Void;<br />
Clear singing, clean slicing;<br />
Sweet spoken, soft finishing;<br />
Making death beautiful,<br />

<p>Forth from the dust and din,<br />
The crush, the heat, the many-spotted glare,<br />
The odour and sense of life and lust aflare,<br />
The wrangle and jangle of unrests,<br />
Let us take horse, dear heart, take horse and win&mdash;<br />
As from swart August to the green lap of May&mdash;<br />
To quietness and the fresh and fragrant breasts<br />
Of the still, delicious night, not yet aware<br />
In any of her innumerable nests<br />
Of that first sudden plash of dawn,<br />
Clear, sapphirine, luminous, large,<br />
Which tells that soon the flowing springs of day<br />
<!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>In deep and ever deeper eddies drawn<br />
Forward and up, in wider and wider way<br />
Shall float the sands and brim the shores<br />
On this our haunch of Earth, as round she roars<br />
And spins into the outlook of the Sun<br />
(The Lord&rsquo;s first gift, the Lord&rsquo;s especial
charge)<br />
With light, with living light, from marge to marge,<br />
Until the course He set and staked be run.</p>
<p>Through street and square, through square and street,<br />
Each with his home-grown quality of dark<br />
And violated silence, loud and fleet,<br />
Waylaid by a merry ghost at every lamp,<br />
The hansom wheels and plunges.&nbsp; Hark, O hark,<br />
Sweet, how the old mare&rsquo;s bit and chain<br />
<!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Ring back a rough refrain<br />
Upon the marked and cheerful tramp<br />
Of her four shoes!&nbsp; Here is the Park,<br />
And O the languid midsummer wafts adust,<br />
The tired midsummer blooms!<br />
O the mysterious distances, the glooms<br />
Romantic, the august<br />
And solemn shapes!&nbsp; At night this City of Trees<br />
Tunis to a tryst of vague and strange<br />
And monstrous Majesties,<br />
Let loose from some dim underworld to range<br />
These terrene vistas till their twilight sets:<br />
When, dispossessed of wonderfulness, they stand<br />
Beggared and common, plain to all the land<br />
For stooks of leaves!&nbsp; And lo! the wizard hour<br />
Whose shining, silent sorcery hath such power!<br />
Still, still the streets, between their carcanets<br />
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Of linking gold, are avenues of sleep:<br />
But see how gable ends and parapets<br />
In gradual beauty and significance<br />
Emerge!&nbsp; And did you hear<br />
That little twitter-and-cheep,<br />
Breaking inordinately loud and clear<br />
On this still, spectral, exquisite atmosphere?<br />
&rsquo;Tis a first nest at matins!&nbsp; And behold<br />
A rakehell cat&mdash;how furtive and acold!<br />
A spent witch homing from some infamous dance&mdash;<br />
Obscene, quick-trotting, see her tip and fade<br />
Through shadowy railings into a pit of shade!<br />
And lo! a little wind and shy,<br />
The smell of ships (that earnest of romance),<br />
A sense of space and water, and thereby<br />
A lamplit bridge ouching the troubled sky.<br />
And look, O look! a tangle of silver gleams<br />
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>And dusky lights, our River and all his dreams,<br />
His dreams of a dead past that cannot die!</p>
<p>What miracle is happening in the air,<br />
Charging the very texture of the gray<br />
With something luminous and rare?<br />
The night goes out like an ill-parcelled fire,<br />
And, as one lights a candle, it is day.<br />
The extinguisher that fain would strut for spire<br />
On the formal little church is not yet green<br />
Across the water: but the house-tops nigher,<br />
The corner-lines, the chimneys&mdash;look how clean,<br />
How new, how naked!&nbsp; See the batch of boats,<br />
Here at the stairs, washed in the fresh-sprung beam!<br />
And those are barges that were goblin floats,<br />
Black, hag-steered, fraught with devilry and dream!<br />
And in the piles the water frolics clear,<br />
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>The ripples into loose rings wander and flee,<br />
And we&mdash;we can behold that could but hear<br />
The ancient River singing as he goes<br />
New-mailed in morning to the ancient Sea.<br />
The gas burns lank and jaded in its glass:<br />
The old Ruffian soon shall yawn himself awake,<br />
And light his pipe, and shoulder his tools, and take<br />
His hobnailed way to work!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us too
pass:<br />
Through these long blindfold rows<br />
Of casements staring blind to right and left,<br />
Each with his gaze turned inward on some piece<br />
Of life in death&rsquo;s own likeness&mdash;Life bereft<br />
Of living looks as by the Great Release<br />
(Perchance of shadow-shapes from shadow-shows),<br />
Whose upshot all men know yet no man knows.</p>
<p>Reach upon reach of burial&mdash;so they feel,<br />
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>These colonies of dreams!&nbsp; And as we steal<br />
Homeward together, but for the buxom breeze<br />
That frolics at our heel,<br />
Greeting the town with news of the summer seas,<br />
We might&mdash;thus awed, thus lonely that we are&mdash;<br />
Be wandering some depopulated star,<br />
Some world of memories and unbroken graves,<br />
So broods the abounding Silence near and far:<br />
Till even your footfall craves<br />
Forgiveness of the majesty it braves.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Scherzando</i></p>
<p>Down through the ancient Strand<br />
The Spirit of October, mild and boon<br />
And sauntering, takes his way<br />
This golden end of afternoon,<br />
As though the corn stood yellow in all the land<br />
And the ripe apples dropped to the harvest-moon.</p>
<p>Lo! the round sun, half down the western slope&mdash;<br />
Seen as along an unglazed telescope&mdash;<br />
Lingers and lolls, loth to be done with day:<br />
Gifting the long, lean, lanky street<br />
And its abounding confluences of being<br />
With aspects generous and bland:<br />
Making a thousand harnesses to shine<br />
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>As with new ore from some enchanted mine,<br />
And every horse&rsquo;s coat so full of sheen<br />
He looks new-tailored, and every &rsquo;bus feels clean,<br />
And never a hansom but is worth the feeing;<br />
And every jeweller within the pale<br />
Offers a real Arabian Night for sale;<br />
And even the roar<br />
Of the strong streams of toil that pause and pour<br />
Eastward and westward sounds suffused&mdash;<br />
Seems as it were bemused<br />
And blurred, and like the speech<br />
Of lazy seas upon a lotus-eating beach&mdash;<br />
With this enchanted lustrousness,<br />
This mellow magic, that (as a man&rsquo;s caress<br />
Brings back to some faded face beloved before<br />
A heavenly shadow of the grace it wore<br />
Ere the poor eyes were minded to beseech)<br />
Old things transfigures, and you hail and bless<br />

24</span>Their looks of long-lapsed loveliness once more;<br />
Till the sedate and mannered elegance<br />
Of Clement&rsquo;s is all tinctured with romance;<br />
The while the fanciful, formal, finicking charm<br />
Of Bride&rsquo;s, that madrigal in stone,<br />
Glows flushed and warm<br />
And beauteous with a beauty not its own;<br />
And the high majesty of Paul&rsquo;s<br />
Uplifts a voice of living light, and calls&mdash;<br />
Calls to his millions to behold and see<br />
How goodly this his London Town can be!</p>
<p>For earth and sky and air<br />
Are golden everywhere,<br />
And golden with a gold so suave and fine<br />
The looking on it lifts the heart like wine.<br />
Trafalgar Square<br />
(The fountains volleying golden glaze)<br />
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Over his couchant Lions in a haze<br />
Shimmering and bland and soft,<br />
A dust of chrysoprase,<br />
Our Sailor takes the golden gaze<br />
Of the saluting sun, and flames superb<br />
As once he flamed it on his ocean round.<br />
The dingy dreariness of the picture-place,<br />
Turned very nearly bright,<br />
Takes on a certain dismal grace,<br />
And shows not all a scandal to the ground.<br />
The very blind man pottering on the kerb,<br />
Among the posies and the ostrich feathers<br />
And the rude voices touched with all the weathers<br />
Of all the varying year,<br />
Shares in the universal alms of light.<br />
The windows, with their fleeting, flickering fires,<br />
The height and spread of frontage shining sheer,<br />
<!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>The glistering signs, the rejoicing roofs and
spires&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis El Dorado&mdash;El Dorado plain,<br />
The Golden City!&nbsp; And when a girl goes by,<br />
Look! as she turns her glancing head,<br />
A call of gold is floated from her ear!<br />
Golden, all golden!&nbsp; In a golden glory,<br />
Long lapsing down a golden coasted sky,<br />
The day not dies but seems<br />
Dispersed in wafts and drifts of gold, and shed<br />
Upon a past of golden song and story<br />
And memories of gold and golden dreams.</p>

The hangman wind that tortures temper and light&mdash;<br />
Comes slouching, sullen and obscene,<br />
Hard on the skirts of the embittered night:<br />
And in a cloud unclean<br />
Of excremental humours, roused to strife<br />
By the operation of some ruinous change<br />
Wherever his evil mandate run and range<br />

A cave of cut-throat thoughts and villainous dreams,<br />
Hag-rid and crying with cold and dirt and wet,<br />

In shameful occultation, seems<br />

With wavering gulfs and antic heights and shifting<br />
Rent in the stuff of a material dark<br />
Wherein the lamplight, scattered and sick and pale,<br />
Shows like the leper&rsquo;s living blotch of bale:<br />
Uncoiling monstrous into street on street<br />

Where man and beast go blindfold and in dread,<br />
Working with oaths and threats and faltering feet<br />
Somewhither in the hideousness ahead;<br />
Working through wicked airs and deadly dews<br />
That make the laden robber grin askance<br />
At the good places in his black romance,<br />
And the poor, loitering harlot rather choose<br />
Go pinched and pined to bed<br />
Than lurk and shiver and curse her wretched way<br />

Sunk in his filthily transfigured sides,<br />

In the squalor of the universal shore:<br />

As from the ferry where the Boat of Doom<br />
With her blaspheming cargo reels and rides:<br />
The while his children, the brave ships,<br />
No more adventurous and fair<br />
Nor tripping it light of heel as home-bound brides,<br />
But infamously enchanted,<br />
Huddle together in the foul eclipse,<br />

From sinister reach to reach&mdash;out&mdash;out&mdash;to
sea.</p>
<p>And Death the while&mdash;<br />
Death with his well-worn, lean, professional smile,<br />
Death in his threadbare working trim&mdash;<br />

And with expert, inevitable hand<br />
Feels at your windpipe, fingers you in the lung,<br />
Or flicks the clot well into the labouring heart:<br />
Thus signifying unto old and young,<br />
However hard of mouth or wild of whim,<br />
&rsquo;Tis time&mdash;&rsquo;tis time by his ancient
watch&mdash;to part<br />
With books and women and talk and drink and art:<br />
And you go humbly after him<br />
To a mean suburban lodging: on the way<br />
To what or where<br />
Not Death, who is old and very wise, can say:<br />
And you&mdash;how should you care<br />
So long as, unreclaimed of hell,<br />
The Wind-Fiend, the insufferable,<br />
Thus vicious and thus patient sits him down<br />
To the black job of burking London Town?</p>

In one great act of faith, while deep and strong,<br />
Incomparably nerved and cheered,<br />

The lewd, perennial, overmastering spell<br />
That keeps the rolling universe ensphered<br />

Wanton and wondrous and for ever well.</p>

<p>When you wake in your crib,<br />
You, an inch of experience&mdash;<br />
Vaulted about<br />
With the wonder of darkness;<br />
Wailing and striving<br />
To reach from your feebleness<br />
Something you feel<br />
Will be good to and cherish you,<br />
Something you know<br />
And can rest upon blindly:<br />
O then a hand<br />

By the fall of its fingers<br />

Out of the dreary,<br />
Discouraging strangenesses<br />

Takes you, and lovingly<br />
Woos you and soothes you<br />
Back, as you cling to it,<br />
Back to some comforting<br />
Corner of sleep.</p>
<p>So you wake in your bed,<br />
Having lived, having loved:<br />
But the shadows are there,<br />
And the world and its kingdoms<br />
Incredibly faded;<br />
And you grope in the Terror<br />
Above you and under<br />
For the light, for the warmth,<br />
<!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Sudden a hand&mdash;<br />
Mother, O Mother!&mdash;<br />
God at His best to you,<br />
Out of the roaring,<br />
Impossible silences,<br />
Falls on and urges you,<br />
Mightily, tenderly,<br />
Forth, as you clutch at it,<br />
Forth to the infinite<br />
Peace of the Grave.</p>

<p>O Time and Change, they range and range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From sunshine round to thunder!&mdash;<br />
They glance and go as the great winds blow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the best of our dreams drive under:<br />
For Time and Change estrange, estrange&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, now they have looked and seen us,<br />
O we that were dear we are all-too near<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the thick of the world between us.</p>
<p>O Death and Time, they chime and chime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like bells at sunset falling!&mdash;<br />
They end the song, they right the wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They set the old echoes calling:<br />

So beggared, so incredibly bereft<br />

<p>Like the forgetfulness<br />
Of the work-a-day world made visible,<br />
A mist falls from the melancholy sky:<br />
A messenger from some lost and loving soul,<br />
Hopeless, far wandered, dazed<br />

Or, each to the other bending, beckoning, signing,<br />
As in some monstrous market-place,<br />
They pass the news, these Gossips of the Prime,<br />
In that old speech their forefathers<br />
Learned on the lawns of Eden, ere they heard<br />
The troubled voice of Eve<br />
Naming the wondering folk of Paradise.</p>
<p>Your sense is sealed, or you should hear them tell<br />
The tale of their dim life and all<br />
Its compost of experience: how the Sun<br />
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Sumptuous, of light, firing them as with wine;<br />
Of the old Moon&rsquo;s fitful solicitude<br />
And those mild messages the Stars<br />
Descend in silver silences and dews;<br />
Or what the buxom West,<br />
Wanton with wading in the swirl of the wheat,<br />
Said, and their leafage laughed;<br />
And how the wet-winged Angel of the Rain<br />
Came whispering . . . whispering; and the gifts of the
Year&mdash;<br />
The sting of the stirring sap<br />
Under the wizardry of the young-eyed Spring,<br />
Their summer amplitudes of pomp<br />
And rich autumnal melancholy, and the shrill,<br />
Embittered housewifery<br />
Of the lean Winter: all such things,<br />
And with them all the goodness of the Master<br />
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>Whose right hand blesses with increase and life,<br />
Whose left hand honours with decay and death.</p>
<p>So, under the constraint of Night,<br />
These gross and simple creatures,<br />
Each in his scores of rings, which rings are years,<br />
A servant of the Will.<br />
And God, the Craftsman, as He walks<br />
The floor of His workshop, hearkens, full of cheer<br />
In thus accomplishing<br />
The aims of His miraculous artistry.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
